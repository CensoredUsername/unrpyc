Unrpyc is a script to decompile Ren'Py (http://www.renpy.org/) compiled .rpyc
script files. It will not extract files from .rpa archives. For that, use rpatool
(https://github.com/Shizmob/rpatool), or UnRPA (https://github.com/Lattyware/unrpa).

Unrpyc needs some internal Ren'Py structures to work. You can either use the -b 
argument to specify the directory in which renpy lies, place the renpy module
in your Python module search path, or copy the renpy folder to the unrpyc directory.

Usage options:

Options:
  --version      show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -c, --clobber  overwrites existing output files
  -b, --basedir  specify the directory in which the renpy folder 
                 resides. using this it is not necessary for the renpy 
                 directory to be in python's search path, or in the 
                 unrpyc directory.
Usage: unrpyc.py [options] script1 script2 ...

You can give several .rpyc files on the command line. Each script will be
decompiled to a corresponding .rpy on the same directory. By default, the
program will not overwrite existing files, use -c to do that.

This script will try to disassemble all AST nodes. In the case it encounters an unknown 
node type, which may be caused by an update to Ren'Py somewhere in the future, a
warning will be printed and a placeholder inserted in the script when it finds a
node it doesn't know how to handle. If you encounter this, please open an issue 
to alert us of the problem.
